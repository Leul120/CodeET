You can grow this project to one of the most successful projects ever. Yes I am talking about building an online education marketplace, something like Udemy! Yes you heard me right, you will learn to build something like Udemy using Full stack JavaScript React.js Next.js Node.js MongoDB Stripe and AWS.\n\nAnother important part of this course is, it is built for production use. Yes when we say production, we need to make sure it is secure, fast, SEO and built with solid infrastructures right? Don’t worry, I have covered all that in the best possible way!\n\nYou will build a secure and production-ready authentication system using cookies. So no more worries about insecurities of storing tokens in local storage. It is extremely fast and SEO optimized because we are using Next.js, which is a React framework for building production apps.\n\nIt is built with solid infrastructures to ultimately scale in the future. We are using AWS SES for emails and S3 for storage. So as you can see, this is an absolutely amazing project to build, that can easily be one of the best startup projects to change the world.\n\nWhether you want to build an online education marketplace for a country or a region or the entire world. This is where it all starts.\n\nAnd it is all done from scratch with nothing but an empty code editor and of course with a lot of passion to learn, build and grow together. In about 5000 lines of code, you will be able to build this masterpiece and deploy to the cloud for the real world.\n\nSo if this sounds amazing, join me in this course.

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional certification is one of the most challenging exams. It requires some substantial hands-on and real-world experience for you to pass. This course is going to help you solidify the knowledge you already have and put it in perspective through the study of various solutions architectures and services.

He does a great job of explaining what he's doing and why rather than having students just mimic his coding. Max was also very responsive to questions. I would recommend this course and any others that he offers.

Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.\n\nThis Course uses TypeScript\n\nTypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular team and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular apps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angular apps. Check out the free videos for more information.\n\nTypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.\n\nWhy Angular?\n\nAngular is the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angular allow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.\n\nAngular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.\n\nDue to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular (= Angular 2+) you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.\n\nGet a very deep understanding of how to create Angular applications\n\nThis course will teach you all the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more! We will take a lot of deep dives and each section is backed up with a real project. All examples showcase the features Angular offers and how to apply them correctly.\n\nSpecifically you will learn:\n\nWhich architecture Angular uses\n\nHow to use TypeScript to write Angular applications\n\nAll about directives and components, including the creation of custom directives/ components\n\nHow databinding works\n\nAll about routing and handling navigation\n\nWhat pipes are and how to use them\n\nHow to send HTTP requests (e.g. to REST APIs)\n\nWhat dependency injection is and how to use it\n\nHow to use modules in Angular\n\nHow to optimize your (bigger) Angular applications\n\nAn introduction to NgRx and complex state management\n\nWe will build a major project in this course so that you can practice all concepts\n\nAnd so much more!",

Hassle-Free Coding and Code templates – We will build all our AIs in Google Colab, which means that we will have absolutely NO hassle installing libraries or packages because everything is already pre-installed in Google Colab notebooks. Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates (in .py and .ipynb) for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.\n\n3. Intuition Tutorials – Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in AI for much better results down the line.\n\n4. Real-world solutions – You’ll achieve your goal in not only one AI model but in 5. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.\n\n5. In-course support – We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.\n\nSo, are you ready to embrace the fascinating world of AI?\n\nCome join us, never stop learning, and enjoy AI!",

  "Description": "Description\nEver wondered how AI technologies like OpenAI ChatGPT, GPT-4, DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion really work? In this course, you will learn the foundations of these groundbreaking applications.\n\nWelcome to Tensorflow 2.0!\n\nWhat an exciting time. It's been nearly 4 years since Tensorflow was released, and the library has evolved to its official second version.\n\nTensorflow is Google's library for deep learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nDeep Learning has been responsible for some amazing achievements recently, such as:\n\nGenerating beautiful, photo-realistic images of people and things that never existed (GANs)\nBeating world champions in the strategy game Go, and complex video games like CS:GO and Dota 2 (Deep Reinforcement Learning)\nSelf-driving cars (Computer Vision)\nSpeech recognition (e.g. Siri) and machine translation (Natural Language Processing)\nEven creating videos of people doing and saying things they never did (DeepFakes - a potentially nefarious application of deep learning)\n\nTensorflow is the world's most popular library for deep learning, and it's built by Google, whose parent Alphabet recently became the most cash-rich company in the world (just a few days before I wrote this). It is the library of choice for many companies doing AI and machine learning.\n\nIn other words, if you want to do deep learning, you gotta know Tensorflow.\n\nThis course is for beginner-level students all the way up to expert-level students. How can this be?\n\nIf you've just taken my free Numpy prerequisite, then you know everything you need to jump right in. We will start with some very basic machine learning models and advance to state of the art concepts.\n\nAlong the way, you will learn about all of the major deep learning architectures, such as Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (image processing), and Recurrent Neural Networks (sequence data).\n\nCurrent projects include:\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nRecommender Systems\nTransfer Learning for Computer Vision\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nDeep Reinforcement Learning Stock Trading Bot\nEven if you've taken all of my previous courses already, you will still learn about how to convert your previous code so that it uses Tensorflow 2.0, and there are all-new and never-before-seen projects in this course such as time series forecasting and how to do stock predictions.\n\nThis course is designed for students who want to learn fast, but there are also \"in-depth\" sections in case you want to dig a little deeper into the theory (like what is a loss function, and what are the different types of gradient descent approaches).\n\nAdvanced Tensorflow topics include:\n\nDeploying a model with Tensorflow Serving (Tensorflow in the cloud)\nDeploying a model with Tensorflow Lite (mobile and embedded applications)\nDistributed Tensorflow training with Distribution Strategies\nWriting your own custom Tensorflow model\nConverting Tensorflow 1.x code to Tensorflow 2.0\nConstants, Variables, and Tensors\nEager execution\nGradient tape\n\nInstructor's Note: This course focuses on breadth rather than depth, with less theory in favor of building more cool stuff. If you are looking for a more theory-dense course, this is not it. Generally, for each of these topics (recommender systems, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, computer vision, GANs, etc.) I already have courses singularly focused on those topics.\n\nThanks for reading, and I’ll see you in class!\n\nWHAT ORDER SHOULD I TAKE YOUR COURSES IN?:\n\nCheck out the lecture  Machine Learning and AI Prerequisite Roadmap (available in the FAQ of any of my courses, including the free Numpy course)\n\n",

Just updated on May 15th, 2023.\n\nMassive new React \"expansion pack\" covers: React basics, JSX, props, state, Vite, MaterialUI, hooks, useEffect, React design patterns, and more.\n\nHi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course.  This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2023 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the only course you need to learn web development. There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market.  Here's why:\n\nThis is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.\n\n92% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.\n\nThe previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost $14,000 and $21,000.  This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.\n\nEverything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2022's developer job market. This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course!\n\nWe build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.\n\nThe course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules.  Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.\n\nYou get to meet my cats and chickens!\n\nWhen you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the \"beginner friendly\" classes.  With this course, you get the best of both worlds.  This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.\n\nThroughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:\n\nHTML5\n\nCSS3\n\nFlexbox\n\nResponsive Design\n\nJavaScript (all 2022 modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.)\n\nAsynchronous JavaScript - Promises, async/await, etc.\n\nAJAX and single page apps\n\nBootstrap 4 and 5\n\nReactJS\n\nSemanticUI\n\nBulma CSS Framework\n\nDOM Manipulation\n\nUnix(Command Line) Commands\n\nNodeJS\n\nNPM\n\nExpressJS\n\nTemplating\n\nREST\n\nSQL vs. NoSQL databases\n\nMongoDB\n\nDatabase Associations\n\nSchema Design\n\nMongoose\n\nAuthentication From Scratch\n\nCookies & Sessions\n\nAuthorization\n\nCommon Security Issues - SQL Injection, XSS, etc.\n\nDeveloper Best Practices\n\nDeploying Apps\n\nCloud Databases\n\nImage Upload and Storage\n\nMaps and Geocoding\n\nThis course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of \"watch as I code\" videos.  This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:\n\nLectures\n\nCode-Alongs\n\nProjects\n\nExercises\n\nResearch Assignments\n\nSlides\n\nDownloads\n\nReadings\n\nToo many pictures of my dog Rusty",

   "Description": "Description\nLast Update: June 2024\n\nWelcome this comprehensive Ethical Hacking course! This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge! It starts with you from scratch and takes you step-by-step teaching you how to hack systems like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts!\n\nThis course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory; we'll start with ethical hacking basics, breakdown the different penetration testing fields and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Apple Mac OS), then we'll dive and start hacking straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by analysing and exploiting different systems such as networks, cloud servers, clients, websites, etc. No boring dry lectures.\n\nThe course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to practically exploit theses weaknesses to hack this system. As we do this I will also introduce you to different hacking and security concepts, tools and techniques. Everything will be taught through examples and hands-on practicals, there will be no useless or boring lectures!\n\nAll the techniques in this course are practical and work against real systems, you'll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you'll learn how to use it to hack the target system . By the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to suit different situations and different scenarios .\n\nBy the end of the course you will have a strong foundation in most hacking or penetration testing fields and you'll also learn how to detect, prevent and secure systems and yourself from the discussed attacks. \n\nThe course is divided into four main sections:   \n\n1. Network Hacking - This section will teach you how to hack and secure both wired & wireless networks. First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:   \n\nPre-connection attacks: in this subsection you'll learn a number of attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without the need to know the network password; you'll learn how to gather information about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections (deny/allow devices from connecting to networks).\n\nGaining Access: Now that you gathered information about the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to crack the key and get the password to your target network whether it uses WEP, WPA or even WPA2 .\n\nPost Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of powerful techniques that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, see anything they do on the internet (such as login information, passwords, visited urls, images, videos, etc.), redirect requests, inject evil code in loaded pages and much more! You will also learn how to create a fake WiFi network or a honeypot, attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.\n\n\n2. Gaining Access - In this section you will learn two main approaches to gain remote access or hack computer systems:\n\nServer Side Attacks:  In this subsection you will learn how to gain full access to computer systems without user interaction. You will learn how to gather useful information about a target system such as the operating system, open ports, installed services, then use this information to discover weaknesses / vulnerabilities and exploit them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will learn how to automatically scan servers for vulnerabilities and generate different types of reports with your discoveries.\n\nClient Side Attacks - If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to hack it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by hijacking software updates or backdooring downloads on the fly. This subsection also teaches you how to use social engineering to hack secure systems, so you'll learn how to gather comprehensive information about system users such as their social accounts, friends, their mails, etc. You'll learn how to create trojans by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use the gathered information to spoof emails so they appear as if they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with, to social engineer them into running your trojan.\n\n\n3. Post Exploitation - In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’ll learn how to access the file system (read/write/upload/execute), maintain your access, spy on the target (capture key strikes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots, etc.) and even use the target computer as a pivot to hack other systems.\n\n4. Website / Web Application Hacking - In this section you will learn how websites work, how to gather information about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies, etc.) and how to discover and exploit the following dangerous vulnerabilities to hack websites:\n\nInformation Disclosure.\nFile Upload.\nCode Execution.\nLocal File Inclusion.\nRemote File Inclusion.\nSQL Injection.\nCross Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n\nThroughout the course you'll learn how to use use the following tools to achieve the above:\n\nVMware.\nKali Linux\nNmap.\nBettercap.\nWireshark.\nOWASP Zap.\nMetasploit.\nNexpose.\nSQLmap.\nMaltego.\nVeil Framework.\nCrunch.\nNetdiscover.\nZenmap.\narpspoof.\nEvilgrade.\nThe Backdoor Factory.\nBeEF.\nDirb.\nKnockpy.\nNetcat.\nAircrack-ng suite .\nAirmon-ng .\nAirodump-ng .\nAireplay-ng .\nAircrack-ng .\n\n\nAt the end of each section you will learn how to detect, prevent and secure systems and yourself from the discussed attacks. \n\nCheckout the curriculum and the course teaser for more info!\n\nWith this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.\n   \nNotes:\n\nThis course is created for educational purposes only, all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against systems that I have permission to test.\n\nThis course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih & zSecurity and no other organisation is associated with it or a certification exam. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that NO OTHER ORGANISATION IS INVOLVED.",
